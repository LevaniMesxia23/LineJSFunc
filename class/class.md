class
In this exercise, you will refactor some code that manages student enrollment records for a workshop, from the namespace pattern to the class pattern.

Instructions
Define a class called Helpers that includes the functions that are not this-aware.

Define a class called Workshop that extends Helpers, which includes all the other functions. Hint: constructor() and super().

Instantiate the Workshop class as deepJS.
